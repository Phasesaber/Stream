        <h1><div class="head-line" style="left:0;"></div>What is Rails?<div class="head-line" style="right:0;"></div></h1>
	<p>Rails is a Minecraft server implementation.  In other words, you use this to run your server.<br>With heavily focused server API and website API, plugin possiblities are endless.  But don't fear if you're not a avid coder, you can always add plugins that others have created and shared with the public.  Not only does Rails offer an API supported in the HTTP protcol, but we're also bringing a new feature called "Panels".  Panels will change the way server owners manage their servers.<br><br><a href="#" style="font-size:25px;float:right;">Learn more about our API</a></p>
	<h1><div class="head-line" style="left:0;"></div>What are Panels?<div class="head-line" style="right:0;"></div></h1>
	<p>Panels are a new feature being brought to Minecraft.<br><br>Panels help server owners easily manager their server with a fluid, easy-to-use, and nice looking website.  This means your server can be controlled from a local website, or you can choose to make your panel public.  Developers have access to a lot of the API behind rails.  This makes websites and minecraft connect in a way like never before.  Imagine a website controlled plugin on your server, e.g. users take a test on the website, then they're rewarded on the server.  This is just a small example of the  possibilities that can be done.<br><br><a href="#" style="font-size:25px;float:right;">Learn more about panels</a></p>
	<h1><div class="head-line" style="left:0;"></div>What are Plugins?<div class="head-line" style="right:0;"></div></h1>
	<p>Want to add some cool modifications to your server? Plugins can enhance your servers game play and customise things that usaly can't be done in vanila. If you'r expierienced enough you can even make your own plugins! If you liked the plugins from Bukkit or Sponge they're compatible too.<br><br><a href="#" style="font-size:25px;float:right;">Learn more about plugins</a></p>
