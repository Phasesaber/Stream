	    <h1><div class="head-line" style="left:0;"></div>Terms of Service<div class="head-line" style="right:0;"></div></h1>
	    <p>In order to protect our Minecraft Server Plugins (our plugins), we have a Terms of Service (TOS) to set out guidelines for our plugins. If you buy, download, use, or play with our plugins, you must agree to the TOS. Players that have connected to your server are not in charge of managing plugins, nor have access to the server files, so they do not have to agree with these terms.</p>

        <h2> - One Big Rule - </h2>
        <p>The one big rule is that you must not distribute anything we've made. You do not own any of the code within the plugin, we created all the code. We did not create Java, nor any other language used for the plugin, nor any APIs used for the plugin, nor Minecraft or Mojang. Though we do not own any of these (APIs or Programming Languages), we own the code within our plugins.</p>
        
		<h2> - Distribution - </h2>
        <p>You must not distribute our plugins anywhere, to any website or any person who does not work directly with you on your server. If you choose to allow us to distribute the plugin on a website, such as PlanetMinecraft or the Sponge Forums, you can not distribute the plugin on your own or on a website.</p>
        
                <h2> - Payment - </h2>
        <p>All payments must be done through <a href="https://paypal.com">PayPal</a>. You will pay after the plugin is completed, which is when we will give you the plugin.</p>
		<h2> - Protection - </h2>
        <p>To protect ourselves, plugins are obfuscated. This means if someone decompiles the code, they can not copy or steal it easily, as the code is scrambled. We do this to assure no one steals our code and sells it.</p>
		
		<h2 id=privacy"> - Privacy - </h2>
		<p>We do not collect data, nor do we send data to anyone. No information about your server, billing, Skype, email, or anything else is saved. No connections within the plugin connect to outside servers (unless asked to, i.e., MySQL), nor do they collect data from IPs.</p>
